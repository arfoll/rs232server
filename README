INTRO

The Cambridge Audio Azur series HDMI receivers (it seems pre HDMI receivers do not have them) have RS232 serial ports
that can be used to control most if not all of the functionality.

COMPATIBILITY

Azur 340R
Azur 540R version 3 (untested but assumed to work)
Azur 640R (untested but assumed to work)

PROGRAM

The program runs in two parts. A python daemon runs in the background and responds to queries from the cli using dbus.
The hope is to decouple the two sufficiently so that other clients can be written. The hope is to eventually have the script
listening to the users media player in order to switch on when neccessary, replace alsa as the volume controller, etc...

INSTALL

requires python2, python-pyserial and dbus

To connect the Amplifier (Azur 340R), use a null modem cable to a serial port or USB->serial controller

USE

example command to mute the amp. You can introspect to get the full output of commands that can be given to the ampserver
dbus-send --system --type=method_call --dest=uk.co.madeo.ampserver /uk/co/madeo/ampserver  uk.co.madeo.ampserver.mute
