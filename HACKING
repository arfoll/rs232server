rs232server hacking documentation

The idea of rs232server is to run a server that listens to Dbus commands. There
can be multiple services. Each service has its own queue and is defined by the
tty (rs232 port) that is used to communicate to that appliance.

There are currently two supported services in rs232server
- azurservice - controls an Azur Amplifier/Receiver
- lgtvservice - controls an LG TV

Dbus commands are received on the /uk/co/madeo/rs232server object. Each service
then has its own interface that can be used to communicate with that service.

Generic:
rs232server.py - the server
serial_queue.py - implements a queue system. One que per service

azur_service.py - the azur service connection
azur_dbus.py - the azur service dbus iface
rs232.conf - the configuration file for the services

rs232client

This is the python client, made mostly for quick testing

miniclient

This is the recommended client for scripting etc... It is not as feature full
as the python client, however it is much faster.
